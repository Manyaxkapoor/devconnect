# DevConnect

A modern frontend developer portfolio platform to **showcase your projects**, **build your profile**, and make an impression in the dev world.

This is a frontend-only project built with React + TailwindCSS, featuring **authentication and storage powered by Supabase**. Designed fully in Figma, the UI is clean, responsive, and production-ready — ideal for a personal portfolio or developer showcase site.
